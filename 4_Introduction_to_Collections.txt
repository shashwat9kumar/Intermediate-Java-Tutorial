ArrayList is a part of collection framework and is present in java.util package. It provides us dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed.

ArrayList inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.
ArrayList is initialized by a size, however the size can increase if collection grows or shrunk if objects are removed from the collection.
Java ArrayList allows us to randomly access the list.
ArrayList can not be used for primitive types, like int, char, etc. We need a wrapper class for such cases (see this for details).
ArrayList in Java can be seen as similar to vector in C++




Now primarily the Java ArrayList can constitute of both Constructors and Methods. Below mentioned is a list of few constructors and methods along with there use and functions.



 

Constructors in Java ArrayList:

ArrayList(): This constructor is used to build an empty array list
ArrayList(Collection c): This constructor is used to build an array list initialized with the elements from collection c
ArrayList(int capacity): This constructor is used to build an array list with initial capacity being specified
Let us look at the code to create generic ArrayList-

// Creating generic integer ArrayList
ArrayList<Integer> arrli = new ArrayList<Integer>();
